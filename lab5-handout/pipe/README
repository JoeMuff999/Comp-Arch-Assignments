This directory contains the code to construct simulators for PIPE and
the variants of it described in the homework exercises.

*************************
1. Building the simulator
*************************

The Makefile can be configured to build simulators that support GUI
and/or TTY interfaces. A simulator running in TTY mode prints all
information about its runtime behavior on the terminal.  It's hard to
understand what's going on, but useful for automated testing, and
doesn't require any special installation features.  A simulator
running in GUI mode uses a fancy graphical user interface.  Nice for
visualizing and debugging, but requires installation of Tcl/Tk on your
system.

The Makefile has simple instructions for building the TTY and GUI
forms. In either case, once you've configured the Makefile, you can
build different versions of the simulators with different HCL files
with commands of the form:

	unix> make clean; make

***********************
2. Using the simulators
***********************

The simulator recognizes the following command line arguments:

Usage: psim [-htg] [-l m] [-v n] file.yo

file.yo required in GUI mode, optional in TTY mode (default stdin)

   -h     Print this message
   -g     Run in GUI mode instead of TTY mode (default TTY mode)
   -l m   Set instruction limit to m [TTY mode only] (default 10000)
   -v n   Set verbosity level to 0 <= n <= 2 [TTY mode only] (default 2)
   -t     Test result against the ISA simulator (yis) [TTY model only]
